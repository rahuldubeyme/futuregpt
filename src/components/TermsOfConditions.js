		<p>4. During the suspension, our Terms will continue to apply.</p>
		<h3>Your Coin Balances</h3>
		<p>A. Your Coin Balances form part of your Account, and allow you to send, receive and store supported Coins (see clause 9), in accordance with instructions provided by you through the Platform.</p>
		<p>B. You must not attempt to send, receive or store unsupported Coins in your Account. Any such actions may result in the loss of the unsupported Coins, or.</p>
		<p>C. You must not send Coins to a wallet address for a different Coin than the currency you are sending. This is commonly known as cross-chain deposit. In recoverable instances, an appropriate recovery fee will be charged for Avonex Exchange executing a cross-chain recovery.</p>
		<p>D. Your Coin Balances are operated by us, and represent entries in your name on the general ledger of ownership of Coins maintained and held by us. This means the Coins in your deposit wallets may be pooled in our internal accounts with other Users' Coins at any time.
E. Each User's entry in the general ledger of ownership of Coins is held by us, on trust, for that User.</p>
		<h4>Fiat Pegged Tokens</h4>
		<p>A. Where we are able to do so (for example, where we can access appropriate banking facilities), we may offer Fiat Pegged Tokens to enable you to upload fiat dollars to your Account in exchange for the equivalent Fiat Pegged Tokens which are tradeable on our Platform.<br/>
B. There will be an individual Fiat Pegged Token for each fiat currency we offer (for example, USDT is a Fiat Pegged Token for US Dollars).<br/>
C. Each Fiat Pegged Token is equivalent to one fiat dollar of the respective fiat currency.<br/>
D. Fiat Pegged Tokens allow you to send, receive and store fiat currencies.<br/>
E. Fiat Pegged Tokens are not financial products in themselves and do not give you any rights or carry any obligations. They are a digital representation of fiat dollars held on trust for you in the Custodial Account. Under these Terms, you hold the beneficial interest in those fiat dollars and can instruct us as trustee to deliver them to you at any time, subject to these Terms (including the risks set out in the Avonex Exchange Risk Statement). We do not promise to pay you any amount in relation to Fiat Pegged Tokens out of our own funds.<br/>
F. In order to obtain Fiat Pegged Tokens from the equivalent fiat currency you must provide us with details of a Nominated Account held with a bank registered to the country of the fiat currency you wish to use. When we are able to offer Fiat Pegged Tokens supported by Avonex Exchange, you can transfer fiat dollars from your Nominated Account to our Custodial Account. We will hold an amount equal to your deposit in the Custodial Account on trust for you. For each fiat dollar we hold in the Custodial Account on your behalf we will issue and credit one equivalent Fiat Pegged Token to your Coin Wallet.<br/>
G. If you transfer or trade a Fiat Pegged Token with another person through our Platform, you instruct us to hold one fiat dollar in the Custodial Account on a new trust for the transferee.<br/>
H. You may request a withdrawal of Fiat Pegged Tokens supported by Avonex Exchange through the Platform and, subject to these Terms, we will pay the equivalent amount in the respective fiat currency from the Custodial Account to your Nominated Account held with a registered bank, subject to any minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts in place, and less any withdrawal fee and deductions required by Applicable Law.<br/>
I. We will try to action any issue of new Fiat Pegged Tokens or your withdrawal request as soon as we are reasonably able to do so. However, there may be a delay as a result of events outside of our control, including as a result of a sudden increase in Transaction volumes, regulatory changes, blockchain issues, or as a result of a request coming through outside of normal banking hours. <br/>
J. You will not receive any interest earned on fiat dollars stored in the Custodial Account. Any interest earned on the Custodial Account will be paid to Avonex Exchange as a fee.<br/>
K. We will not use the fiat dollars held on trust in the Custodial Account for any purpose other than to meet our obligations to you in respect of your Fiat Pegged Tokens, nor can we charge or otherwise encumber them.<br/>
L. Fiat Pegged Tokens are available at our discretion. For regulatory, commercial or other reasons we may give notice to Users that we have decided to suspend or to cease offering one or more of our Fiat Pegged Tokens. If we cease offering a Fiat Pegged Token we will, where possible, give affected Users notice of a timeframe within which they must withdraw, or exchange for Coins, the Fiat Pegged Tokens in their Wallets. Any remaining Fiat Pegged Tokens will, after this time, be withdrawn and the matching fiat dollar amount paid to the relevant User's Nominated Account. If this is unavailable or difficult Avonex Exchange may instead choose to remove the tokens from your account and replace them with the equivalent value of Prince XC or another major currency at an appropriate market rate of exchange.</p>

	<h3>Supported Coins</h3>
	<p><strong>Supported Coins</strong></p>

		<p>1. We will from time to time publish a list of Coins supported on our Platform.<br/>
2. It is your responsibility to determine whether you should acquire, exchange or sell any Coin, and you should seek professional advice before doing so. By supporting a Coin on our Platform, we make no representations, and give no warranties:<br/>
1. whether you should purchase, sell, or hold any Coin, or in relation to the performance, value of or benefits associated with that Coin;<br/>
2. as to any rights or obligations you may have as a holder of that Coin;<br/>
3. as to whether the terms of the Coin have been accurately represented by the issuer or any promoter of that Coin;
4. the success of any business or project related to any Coin;<br/>
5. that the issuer has complied with any or all Applicable Laws in relation to that Coin, or that it has received any required regulatory approvals, licences, or registrations to enable it to issue or offer the Coin.<br/>
3. Avonex Exchange, its officers, employees, agents and contractors do not provide any advice in relation to Transactions. You must not rely on anything we say as intended to:<br/><br/>
1. pass judgement on the merits of any particular Coin;<br/>

2. endorse, sponsor or recommend any Coin supported on the Platform;<br/>
3. make any recommendation regarding the advisability of investing in any Coin for any particular individual.<br/>

5. It is your responsibility to confirm that any Coin is a supported Coin. You will be responsible for any loss incurred as a result of sending, depositing or returning any Coins that are not supported by us.</p>

<h3>Coins in Maintenance</h3>

5. other blockchain related issues.<br/>
3. We do not accept any liability, either directly or indirectly, for any loss caused by placing a Coin into maintenance.</p>

<h3>Delisting Coins</h3>

		<p>1. From time to time, we may delist Coins from the Platform (meaning they can no longer be traded) for technical, legal or any other reason at our discretion.<br/>
2. Generally, the procedure in which we will delist a specific Coin is as follows:<br/>
1. the market for the Coin is closed and from that point you will not be able to buy or sell the Coin<br/>
2. we will give at least a 30 day notice on the removal of the Coin. At that time, the status of the Coin becomes "delisting"<br/>
3. During the 30 day notice period, you must ensure that you withdraw the specific Coin from the Platform, to an external wallet, and cancel any outstanding Transactions. If you do not withdraw your balance of the Coin from the Platform you may lose the balance of the Coin at the time it is removed.<br/>
4. After the notice period and once the Coin is delisted, the Coin will no longer be able to be deposited, withdrawn, bought or sold on the platform. If possible, any un-processed Transactions in respect of the Coin will not be processed and any related Coin or amount will be returned to the User.<br/>
5. You acknowledge that we may immediately delist a Coin, without following the process set out above, where the removal is urgently required for compliance with any Applicable Law or where we consider the continued support of the Coin may result in a serious risk of harm or legal liability to us, the Platform, the Services or any User.<br/>
6. You acknowledge that some Coins may be delisted without the option to withdraw the Coin from the Platform during the 30 day notice period. This will occur when the Coin is unable to be withdrawn due to technical, legal or any other reason at our discretion.<br/>
7. Avonex Exchange does not accept any liability, either directly or indirectly, with any loss caused by delisting a Coin.</p>
